# WeatherPy

## OVERVIEW
For the advance features to the PlanMyTrip application, we were approached to append more data to the database, or cities DataFrame, so clients know the climate in the city by just clicking a pop-up marker. 

We additionally added the features to know humidity, cloudiness and other weather factors for most recent three hours for the target location that our clients can filter the DataFrame utilizing input statement. 

At last, directions layer generated by Google map that can guide the directions between various cities for travel via different travel modes.

<li>Generate a new DataFrame from a new API search with new weather variables.</li>

<li>Utilize Pandas techniques and functionality on a DataFrame or Series.</li>

<li>Filter DataFrames for better outcome using input and nested decision statements, logical expressions and Python fuctionality.</li>

<li>Apply nested try-except blocks to prevent unnecessary blockage of code.</li>

<li>Use Python functions to analyse and visualize data.</li>
